Email Verifier tool allows you to verify your email contact list with ease and accuracy.

All you need to do is input the email addresses you want to verify, and our tool will handle the rest. Here's what our tool checks:

1. Email Syntax: Ensures the email address is in the correct format.

2. Email Domain: Verifies that the domain is valid and active.

3. MX Record: Checks for the existence of an email server for the provided domain.

4. Email Existence: Confirms that the email address actually exists and can receive emails.

5. Individual Email Verification: Each email address is verified individually to ensure accuracy.

6. Public Source Check: The tool also checks all available public sources for the email address and provides the last discovery dates.

7. Domain WHOIS Data: It extracts information about the domain from WHOIS data.

Should you have any questions or suggestions, please do not hesitate to reach us at info@tomba.io.
